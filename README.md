# Personal-Website
I decided to add my personal website as it can include much more stuff than my resume could. I would also like to add some simple functionalities to facilitate my daily life. Will keep adding some new features and see how far it goes.

I'm thinking of doing this in the issue/PR way that I did back in the summmer, where features are broke down into issues and each time a new functionality is added, a new PR will be created and address the issue correspondingly. Although myself is the only contributor, I think this way it is easier to keep things really clear and organized.
